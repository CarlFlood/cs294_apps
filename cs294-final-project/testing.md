This is a write-up reflecting on the user testing I did and the changes I made to reflect the results of that testing.

The subject a 19-year-old female with moderate computer expertise. They initially had trouble understanding what to do after opening the app.
After given instruction, they were able to make selections and view health code violations as well as add reviews and photos easily.
Their feedback that it was intuitive once they knew what the purpose was, but it was confusing to get started.

I have implemented a small instruction box to explain how the app is meant to function. It explains how to get started
and how to install the application.
